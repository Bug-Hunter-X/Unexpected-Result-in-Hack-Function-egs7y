# Unexpected Result in Hack Function

This repository demonstrates an unexpected result in a simple Hack function. The function `baz` is designed to add one to its argument, then multiply by two, and finally subtract one. However, it does not produce the expected result.

The bug.hack file contains the buggy code. The bugSolution.hack file contains the corrected code. The README describes the problem and solution.
